**Dataflow** - data structures, tools and utilities for 
[Dart](https://dart.dev/) and [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) mobile developers
to help on handling dynamic structured data and fetching it from various data
sources.

separate
[Geospatial tools for Dart](https://github.com/navibyte/geospatial) repository.
